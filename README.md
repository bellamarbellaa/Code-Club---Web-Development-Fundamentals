As part of Udemy’s Web Development Course I completed in April 2024, I was guided to build "Code Club," 
a four-page website designed to bring coding enthusiasts together. This project includes:

Home: An inviting introduction to the club’s mission and activities.
About: Detailed information on club meetings, projects, and values.
Members Area: An exclusive page for members, with event information.
Password: A secure login interface that restricts access to the members area.

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript extensively, crafting a cohesive layout, a custom navigation bar, and an interactive member login. 
Below I list a summary of my works in this project: 
1. Responsive Design: I built a clean, responsive layout that looks great on any device. The custom navigation bar ties everything together and makes it easy to explore the site.
2. Member-Only Access: I created a secure login page for the Members Area with JavaScript-based password validation. Users get real-time feedback if they enter the wrong password.
3. Interactive Elements: I added engaging elements like custom alerts and password prompts using JavaScript to make the site more dynamic. Event listeners on buttons and forms keep the interaction smooth.
4. Structured Content: Each page is organized for easy reading, with a clear layout and fun visuals that showcase the club’s activities and values. The Members Area has a special invite message, adding a personal touch.
5. Consistent Styling: I used a cohesive color scheme, fonts, and animations across all pages to give Code Club a unique and professional vibe.

This project shows my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and reflects my ability to build user-friendly, interactive web experiences.
